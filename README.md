Hey There, i am python developer 💻

I can crete TG bots, discord bot, chatbots 🤖

so, this is just web content scraping tool for moderate website🫠.                
for high-end websites we need proxies to purchase💵          
you can scrap basic content such as images🖼️, videos🎦, audios🎧 from it. 

for first time installation       
`pip install -r requirements`

to Start the Tool            
`python run.py`

🟥 you can host it on your own localhost              
🟥 Scrapped content will be saved on the specific Data📂/folder

how it works:-        
1.First it scraps the raw HTML data of Site        
2. finds the content from that html raw data
